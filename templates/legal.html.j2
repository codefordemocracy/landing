  <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium mb-3">Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p class="mb-7 text-muted">Last Updated: February 17, 2021</p>

  <p class="mb-5">This privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) is to help you understand what information Code For Democracy collects, how we use it, how it may be shared and what choices and rights you have with respect to your information. This Privacy Policy governs the website and other digital products and services (collectively, “Services”) offered by Code For Democracy, Inc., a Massachusetts 501(c)(3) corporation (“CFD,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). Additionally, our Terms of Service are incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h5 class="text-xl font-medium mt-7 mb-5">1. Information We Collect</h5>
  <p class="mb-5">While using our Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). We use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the Services. By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h6 class="font-medium mb-5">Information that you provide us</h6>
  <p class="mb-5"><em>Purchases and Sales</em></p>

We do not store your payment or banking information. Information that you provide to Stripe is governed by their privacy policy, which is available at https://stripe.com/privacy.</p>
  <p class="mb-5"><em>Communications with CFD</em></p>
  <p class="mb-5">If you contact CFD, either through our website, e-mail or otherwise, we may keep your message, e-mail address and contact information to respond to your request.</p>

  <h6 class="font-medium mb-5">Information that we collect automatically</h6>
  <p class="mb-5"><em>Log Data</em></p>
  <p class="mb-5">When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This log data may include your IP address, the address of the web pages you visited, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used the Services, and cookie data.</p>
  <p class="mb-5"><em>Cookie Data</em></p>
  <p class="mb-5">Depending on how you are accessing the Services, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our Services, unique to your browser or similar technologies to record Log Data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies. However, if you choose to refuse cookies, some features of the Services may not function properly.</p>
  <p class="mb-5"><em>Device Information</em></p>
  <p class="mb-5">In addition to Log Data, we may also collect information about the device on which you are using the Services, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.</p>
  <p class="mb-5"><em>Do Not Track</em></p>
  <p class="mb-5">Your browser may support a “Do Not Track” option that can be selected in your browser settings, which sends a signal to websites you visit informing them that you do not want certain information about your visit to be collected. At this time we do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.</p>
  <p class="mb-5"><em>Analytics and Usage</em></p>
  <p class="mb-5">We use data analytics and work with certain third party service providers, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand and improve the use of our Services.

  <h5 class="text-xl font-medium mt-7 mb-5">18. Dispute Resolution</h5>
  <p class="mb-5">You and CFD agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or to your use of the Services (collectively “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and CFD each are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff as a class member in any class action proceeding. Further, unless you and CFD agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not preside over any form class action proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of the Terms contained in these Terms.</p>
  <p class="mb-5"><u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</u> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at http://www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Federal Arbitration act will govern the interpretation of this section.</p>
  <p class="mb-5"><u>Arbitration Process.</u> A party who desires to initiate the arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 7 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with AAA Rules.</p>
  <p class="mb-5"><u>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</u> Unless you and CFD agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, California. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and CFD submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing and the arbitrator then determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by AAA Rules. Subject to AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
  <p class="mb-5"><u>Arbitrator’s Decision.</u> The arbitrator will render an award within the timeframe specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any award of damages by an arbitrator must be consistent with the “Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability” section above. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of the claimant only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.</p>
  <p class="mb-5"><u>Fees.</u> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be as set forth in the AAA Rules.</p>

  <h5 class="text-xl font-medium mt-7 mb-5">19. General</h5>
